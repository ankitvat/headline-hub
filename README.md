# Welcome to Headline Hub ðŸ‘‹

This is a news application created using Expo.

## Tech Stack

- Expo
- Zustand (State Management and persistence).
- Axios (Data fetching)

## Assumptions

Most of the functionality lies in the useStore hook

- Data fetching
- offline persistence
- Pinning and unpinning posts.
- Handling the 10 sec api logic.

The imageURL for the source was not available in the response sample.

Also when I went through the docs and called the API .. It was only fetching around 60-70 articles so I've implemented based on those conditions.
